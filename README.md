# CSC207-Project
This an Android app I developed as part of a team of 5 (Contributors: Vaskar Nath, Valeriia Fakhrutdinova, Elexandra Tran,
Peter Potaptchik) for a second-year Software Development Course at U of T. It consists of three independent games, each with
associated gameplay statistics and tweakable settings, and a user account system (managed locally on the device).

If you'd like to see part of the project that I developed by myself, navigate to:

CSC207-Project/phase2/Game/app/src/main/java/com/example/game/BlackjackGame/

This isn't the only part of the project that I worked on, but it's the part that is wholly my own.

The "phase1" folder contains the first draft of the project, while "phase2" is the final version that we submitted for grading.
